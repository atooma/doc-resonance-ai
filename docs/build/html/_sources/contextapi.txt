Context API
==================

Context Detection is the core of Resonance AI and itâ€™s based on the idea of determining what user is doing, by combining information coming from different data sources (e.g. Android / iOS devices, wearables, external systems) and processing them through advanced models developed for Google Tensorflow.

The Context API are organized in eight groups:

* Basic: this group gives information about the type of the movement of the user;
* Vehicle: this group gives information about the type of in-vehicles movement of the user;
* User Places: this group gives access to user's favorite locations;
* On Foot: this group knows if user does certain activities on foot;
* Entertainment: this group gives information about the type of leisure activities;
* Health
* Business
* Holidays
